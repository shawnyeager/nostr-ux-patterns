# Source Files

This directory contains verified source files that support the pattern documentation.

---

## Purpose

These are **source material collections** that inform the pattern documents and master bibliography. They represent the sources gathered during pattern identification and analysis.

**Distinction:**

- `research/` = Source files with verified citations
- `appendices/` = Polished documentation and deep-dive analysis
- `patterns/` = Final pattern documents

---

## Citation Policy

**All findings must have verifiable URLs or be removed.**

Every claim in these files includes:

- Direct quote or specific finding
- Source URL (must be accessible)
- Date of publication/access
- Context and relevance

This strict policy ensures all sources are traceable and verifiable.
